# opencv_OE11_logging_11003_wiki

Personal wiki for contribution to OpenCV OE11 (logging rehaul). This is not a source code repository.

This wiki tracks kinchungwong's contributions to OpenCV's Evolution Proposal 11, a rehaul of logging system inside the OpenCV library. Originally intended to be ready for the 4.0.0 release, it lapsed without real progress due to initial lack of volunteering contributors from the public. The proposal has since picked up steam, with a tentative milestone of the future 4.1 release.

While this contribution is actively assisted by the OpenCV project maintainers, information on this page and similarly related pages should not be seen as having been reviewed, approved, or endorsed by the OpenCV project team.
